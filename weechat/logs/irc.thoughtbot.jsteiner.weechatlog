2014-05-28 10:14:29	jsteiner	Als for lunch today?
2014-05-28 10:14:43	jsteiner	if you go here and click through, you can get $2 of https://www.thelevelup.com/claim_for_existing_user?cohort_code=H8Y4FMORSP 
2014-05-28 10:14:44	jsteiner	off
2014-05-28 10:14:59	justin	ooo... yeah lets do it
2014-05-28 10:15:05	justin	i'll have a light dinner
2014-05-28 10:17:26	justin	I have been messing around with window managers to maybe fix the weechat problem... do you have one that you were using that you were building into the dotfiles? I thought I remembered something like that
2014-05-28 10:17:41	jsteiner	slate
2014-05-28 10:17:57	jsteiner	I have a slaterc too, it's just not checked in
2014-05-28 10:18:08	jsteiner	Are you on chruby btw?
2014-05-28 10:19:46	jsteiner	If so, I want to merge in my chruby branch
2014-05-28 10:20:14	justin	yeah i am fully on chruby
2014-05-28 10:20:19	jsteiner	cool
2014-05-28 10:20:28	justin	it was pretty easy after all was said and done
2014-05-28 10:24:56	justin	have you used spectacle?
2014-05-28 10:25:37	jsteiner	nope. I used to use divvy, but slate is free, open source, and configurable: https://github.com/jigish/slate

2014-05-28 10:25:54	jsteiner	You can just have the configuration in your dotfiles, which is nice
2014-05-28 10:27:18	justin	I wonder if that's the "fix" for weechat... trying to figure out how to have the same weechat session always on my screen
2014-05-28 10:27:29	jsteiner	Oh, no that's different
2014-05-28 10:28:25	justin	well, yeah but i think if I used a window manager to "organize" my windows then it might work
2014-05-28 10:28:48	jsteiner	These are for organizing GUI windows
2014-05-28 10:28:58	justin	like have an iterm with weechat on the bottom right at all times and then iterm with tmux is some other percentage of my screen
2014-05-28 10:29:20	justin	I am doing it right now with spectacle
2014-05-28 10:29:25	jsteiner	Idk. I feel like i'd rather just have weechat inside of tmux, but available to all sessions
2014-05-28 10:30:20	justin	yeah... I like that better... thinking that it might be something that I will have to start outside of tmux and then connect to it through a pane in the session
2014-05-28 10:30:32	justin	or another window in the session
2014-05-28 10:30:47	jsteiner	I'm looking if anybody already has a solution for windows or panes that are available across sessions
2014-05-28 10:31:16	justin	have you started using weechat?
2014-05-28 10:31:19	jsteiner	nope
2014-05-28 10:31:24	jsteiner	I won't until we can figure this out
2014-05-28 10:31:30	jsteiner	I'm using the mac app
2014-05-28 10:32:12	justin	I am liking it and I am getting a nice color scheme and plugin list, so that we can extract out, because it saves everything in a dot directory
2014-05-28 10:32:29	jsteiner	yeah, that'll be nice
2014-05-28 10:33:07	jsteiner	https://coderwall.com/p/9cdaaw 
2014-05-28 10:33:21	justin	we could bind this : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3094946/move-window-between-tmux-clients
2014-05-28 10:33:39	jsteiner	no, we don't want to move it around
2014-05-28 10:33:46	jsteiner	check out my link. I think that's close to what we want
2014-05-28 10:33:57	justin	yeah, reading it now... the 
2014-05-28 10:34:05	justin	"want" is exactly the same
2014-05-28 10:34:43	jsteiner	are you saying both links are the same?
2014-05-28 10:35:06	justin	no... i am saying that your link is exactly what we want
2014-05-28 10:35:10	jsteiner	ah
2014-05-28 10:35:32	jsteiner	yeah, i think that could be cool
2014-05-28 10:35:38	jsteiner	If not annoying.
2014-05-28 10:35:42	justin	i am going to play around with it
2014-05-28 10:35:49	jsteiner	:thumbsup:
2014-05-28 10:36:09	justin	ooo... weechat isn't showing the emoticons
2014-05-28 10:36:13	justin	gotta get that plugin
2014-05-28 10:36:14	jsteiner	another thing, mostly the same thing: http://blog.tekerson.com/2013/05/28/share-tmux-windows-across-sessions/
