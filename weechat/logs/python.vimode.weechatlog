2014-05-25 18:58:40		Description:
2014-05-25 18:58:40		An attempt to add a vi-like mode to WeeChat, which provides some common vi key bindings and commands, as well as normal/insert modes.
2014-05-25 18:58:40		Usage:
2014-05-25 18:58:40		To switch to Normal mode, press Ctrl + Space. The Escape key can be used as well. The Esc key will conflict with existing key bindings (e.g. Esc followed by 'd' will be detected as meta-d) for WeeChat ≤ 0.4.3.
2014-05-25 18:58:40		It works as expected for WeeChat ≥ 0.4.4. You can get the latest WeeChat from http://weechat.org/download/devel/
2014-05-25 18:58:40		You can use the mode_indicator bar item to view the current mode.
2014-05-25 18:58:40		To switch back to Insert mode, you can use i/a/A (or the c operator.)
2014-05-25 18:58:40		To execute a command, simply precede it with a ':' while in normal mode, for example: ":h" or ":s/foo/bar".
2014-05-25 18:58:40		Current key bindings:
2014-05-25 18:58:40		Input line:
2014-05-25 18:58:40		Operators:
2014-05-25 18:58:40		d{motion}   Delete text that {motion} moves over.
2014-05-25 18:58:40		c{motion}   Delete {motion} text and start insert.
2014-05-25 18:58:40		y{motion}   Yank {motion} text to clipboard.
2014-05-25 18:58:40		Motions:
2014-05-25 18:58:40		h    [count] characters to the left exclusive.

2014-05-25 18:58:40		yy   Yank line.
2014-05-25 18:58:40		I    Insert text before the first non-blank in the line.
2014-05-25 18:58:40		p    Put the text from the clipboard after the cursor.

If the 'g' flag isn't present, only the first match will be substituted. Escapes are not interpreted for repl (e.g. '\&'), and '/' isn't expected to be used/escaped anywhere in the command.
